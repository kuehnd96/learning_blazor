# Learning Blazor

This will hold any code that is written while reading David Pine's book ["Learning Blazor"](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/learning-blazor/9781098113230/). I have been working with .NET since 2002 and am excited to learn something new that uses C#, Visual Studio, and .NET tools.
